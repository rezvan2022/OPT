This folder consists of two different clusters of codes: 
The fisrt set are sample codes to implemtnt and compare different optimization function inside MATLAB namely
--FminuncVSFminsearch
--HalvingvsGoldenSection
--QuadVSNewtonVSQuasi_Newton
--newffVSnewcf
The second cluster in folder ThrustOptimization with NN&FminCon is
 the whole coding process + a technical repot of:
 -- an optimization process for maximizing
the thrust production for a supersonic nozzle. 
---The optimization algorithm is a combination of CFD analysis, artificial neural network training and a
constrained function minimization.
